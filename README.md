# Spring Boot CRUD Operations 🚀

Hello Sharief 👋,

I started Learing Spring Boot, As you suggested I created a CRUD features on MySQL database using **Spring Boot**. This is exercise helped me undertand the basic structure of SpringBoot, the setup process and the posibilites of Spring Boot. This is what i learned from this Exercise

### What I Learned 📚

- **Controller-Service-Repository Model**:
  - I utilized the **Controller-Service-Repository** pattern, which organizes the application into three layers: Controller (handles HTTP requests), Service (business logic), and Repository (database operations). This is the standard structure which helps in keeping the code clean and maintainable. 💻

- **Dependency Injection**:
  - I explored **Dependency Injection**, a fundamental concept in Spring Boot that allows for loose coupling between components. Although I don't completely understand the methodology yet, I have grasped the basics and its importance. 🧩

- **Spring Boot JPA**:
  - I worked with **Spring Boot JPA** to interact with the MySQL database. This abstraction layer simplifies database operations and integrates seamlessly with Hibernate, it helped me to avoid writing all the SQL query statements and simplified the code. 📦

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - I implemented full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Testing these operations with **Postman** confirmed that they work correctly.✅

I've found Spring Boot really interesting. I would appreciate any feedback you have on my work and suggestions for improvement. 
I'm also looking for more hands on activites like this on Spring Boot to gain more experience.

Thank you.
